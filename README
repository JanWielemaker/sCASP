s(CASP) Internal Documentation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Introduction
============

s(CASP), by [Joaquin Arias](joaquin.arias@imdea.org), is based 
on s(ASP). s(CASP) allows left recursion and constraints. Visit
https://gitlab.software.imdea.org/joaquin.arias/sCASP for the 
s(CASP) source code.

s(ASP) is an implementation of the stable model semantics of logic
programming by [Kyle Marple](kmarple1@hotmail.com). Unlike similar
systems, it does not employ any form of grounding. This allows s(ASP)
to execute programs that are not finitely groundable, including those
which make use of lists and terms. Work on s(ASP) is supported by the
National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1423419 visit
https://sourceforge.net/projects/sasp-system/ for the s(ASP) source
code.


Installation of s(CASP) 
=======================

To run s(CASP) you need CIAO Prolog with TCLP working in your computer.
       %% ask [Joaquin Arias](joaquin.arias@imdea.org) %%


Then compile the s(CASP) source code (from the directiory src) using:

For Mac-OS / Linux
------------------

ciaoc -x -o scasp scasp.pl


it generates an executable file named scasp which you can place
wherever you want...

For Windows
-----------

ciaoc-1.14 -o scasp scasp.pl

it generates an executable file named scasp (it is recommended to
execute it from .\src\).


Usage of s(CASP)
================

Usage: scasp [options] InputFile(s)

s(CASP) computes stable models of ungrounded normal logic programs.
Command-line switches are case-sensitive!

 General Options:

  -h, -?, --help        Print this help message and terminate.
  -i, --interactive     Run in user / interactive mode.
  -a, --auto            Run in automatic mode (no user interaction).
  -sN, -nN              Compute N answer sets, where N >= 0. 0 for all.
  -v, --verbose         Enable verbose progress messages.
  -j, --justification   Print proof tree for each solution.
  -d0                   Print the program translated (with duals and nmr_check).

Examples of use
---------------

To obtain one model of the program (i.e. test.pl)
   $ ./scasp test.pl
   Answer: 1
   { q(X), not p(X) }
   $

To obtain all the models (answers) of test.pl
   $ ./scasp -s0 test.pl

To obtain 5 answers of test.pl
   $ ./scasp -s5 test.pl

To print the "translation" of the code (with duals predicates and
check-rules)
   $ ./scasp -d0 test.pl

To use scasp with its iterative mode:
   $ ./scasp -i test.pl
   ?- p(X).
   { p(X), not q(X) } ? 

   false.
   ?- q(X).
   { q(X), not p(X) } ? ;

   false.
   ?- halt.
   $

The example program test.pl is:
   p(X) :- not q(X).
   q(X) :- not p(X).

   ?- q(X).

Note that the program include the query in order to be use without
iterative mode...
