The s(CASP) system is a top-down interpreter for ASP programs with
constraints.

@section{Details}

s(CASP) (available at
@href{https://gitlab.software.imdea.org/joaquin.arias/sCASP} by
Joaquin Arias (visit
@href{https://software.imdea.org/~joaquin.arias}, is based on s(ASP)
(available at @href{https://sourceforge.net/projects/sasp-system}) by
University of Texas at Dallas.

s(CASP) is an implementation of the stable model semantics of
constraint logic programming. Unlike similar systems, it does not
employ any form of grounding. This allows s(CASP) to execute programs
that are not finitely groundable, including those which make use of
lists and terms.

@section{Overview of this document} 

This document is divided in two parts:

@begin{itemize} 

@item @bf{Part I - Installation}. It explains how to download and
install this this bundle.


@item @bf{Part II - Usage}. s(CASP) Usage details how to use this
bundle and its options. Also, several execution modes are shown.
