Example of compiled files to be invoke using -c or --compiled:

        scasp -c birds_compiled.pl



The order of the clauses in the compiled file affects the run-time:

- To obtain the order generated by the s(ASP)/s(CASP) compiler invoke:

    scasp --code --raw ../birds.pl > birds_compiled_raw.pl

- To obtain the readable version generated by s(CASP) invoke:

    scasp --code ../birds.pl > birds_compiled.pl



NOTE: to keep the variable names in the query of the compiled
version rename them as atoms. For example:

        ?- flies(X).   -->    ?- flies('X').
